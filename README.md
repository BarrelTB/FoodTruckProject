## Food Truck Project

This program tracks input food trucks via their name, food type, and rating. As well the program auto generates a unique ID for each food truck object input into the system.

### Week 3 Homework for Skill Distillery
This program is a homework assignment for week 3 of the Skill Distillery Java coding bootcamp course.

### How to use

#### Step 1:
  The user is prompted to enter a food truck name or to quit. If the user quits before entering any data the program exits saying "Thank you for playing."

#### Step 2:
  If the user decides to enter the name of a food truck, the user is then prompted for the type of food truck and the rating of the food truck.

#### Step 3:
  After entering the first set of data (Food Truck name, Food Truck type, and Rating), the user is then looped around to the same prompt as Step 1. The user can then enter up to 4 more food trucks, or they can quit to continue on with the rest of the program.

#### Step 4:
  If the user quits to continue on with the rest of the program, or continues to enter up to 5 total food trucks the program will now execute the next set of code, which is a menu the user can choose from.

#### Step 5:
  Choosing option 1: Displaying All Available Food Trucks.

#### Step 6:
  Choosing option 2: Finding the Average Rating of All the Food Trucks

#### Step 7:
  Choosing option 3: Displaying the Truck with the Highest Rating.

#### Step 8:
  Choosing option 4: Quitting the program.

### Topics
 - Objects : Creating a FoodTruckApp object to access non static methods
 - Switches : Using switches to determine userInput
 - Non-Static fields : Passing in userInput data when creating Food Truck objects
 - Non-Static methods : Accessing and utilizing non-static methods
 - Object Arrays : Creating/implementing Food Truck object array

### Technologies
- Java : Java version 1.8
- Eclipse IDE
- Atom text editor
- GitHub
- Git commands
- shell

### Lessons Learned

- Lesson 1 : When userInput is expecting an INT, the scanner needs to be manually set to the next line or it will skip areas of code on the next loop.

- Lesson 2 : With object arrays, figuring out the programming logic to not include null value objects when printing available Food Trucks, calculating average, and finding the highest rated Food Truck.

- Lesson 3: Working with README and GitHub to properly show screenshots to allow a reader better understand of the program.
