### Step 3:
  After entering the first set of data (Food Truck name, Food Truck type, and Rating), the user is then looped around to the same prompt as Step 1. The user can then enter up to 4 more food trucks, or they can quit to continue on with the rest of the program.

### Step 4:
  If the user quits to continue on with the rest of the program, or continues to enter up to 5 total food trucks the program will now execute the next set of code, which is a menu the user can choose from.
